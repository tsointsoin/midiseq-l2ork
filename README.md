# midiseq-l2ork
Midi sequencer for pd-l2ork (Purr-Data : https://agraef.github.io/purr-data/ ) including Ableton-Link support.

This sequencer is heavily based on the sequencer of the Roland SH-101, i.e: time data and note data are separated.
There is a scale constraint option based on the scales of the Zaquencer.
